# üêç Beginner Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-level Python projects! These projects were created as part of my learning journey while exploring Python fundamentals, including:

- Variables & Data Types  
- Input/Output  
- Loops & Conditionals  
- Functions  
- Modules  
- Collections (Lists, Dictionaries, etc.)  
- Strings Manipulation  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Each project helped me apply and solidify these concepts in a practical way.
